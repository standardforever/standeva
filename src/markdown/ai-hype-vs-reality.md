Process Zero builds private, secure AI automation agents that work inside your environment to remove repetitive digital tasks from your organisation.

Our agents handle the work your team currently completes manually   logging into systems, reading information, applying logic, and updating data across tools   so your people can focus on higher-value work that drives growth.

**We don't sell generic chatbots.**
We deliver closed-loop, private AI automation that integrates with your existing systems and processes.

## can your tasks be automated? the simple rule

A practical rule we use with clients:

**If you repeat a digital task more than three times a week, it uses a mouse or keyboard, follows predictable steps, and isn't a regulated compliance action   an AI automation agent can almost certainly automate it.**

These tasks drain your team's time but add little strategic value.
Our agents take them over completely.

## what we build

### AI automation agents

Agents that can:

- Take data from one system in structured or unstructured formats
- Understand and interpret that data using private LLMs
- Apply your rules, validations, and decision logic
- Transform the data into the required output
- Insert, update, amend, or reconcile that information in another system

**Example:**
Extract CRM data → validate it → automatically create or update records in your accounting or operations systems.

Your data stays private and protected throughout the process.

---

### intelligent assistants for teams

Private assistants trained on your business processes, capable of:

- Drafting documents, emails, and reports
- Summarising internal information
- Searching your knowledge bases
- Answering operational questions
- Supporting finance, HR, compliance, or customer service workflows

**These assistants run privately for your organisation   not public AI tools.**

---

### document & data automation

We automate data extraction and processing from:

- PDFs
- Invoices
- HR records
- Supplier documents
- Customer forms
- Compliance documents

Agents read, understand, validate, and route data into your systems automatically   removing manual entry and reducing errors.

---

### workflow & system automation

Our agents connect and automate:

- Finance workflows
- HR and onboarding processes
- Sales operations
- Customer service triage
- Supply chain updates
- Reporting cycles
- Compliance and audit tasks

**If your team currently clicks, types, copies, pastes, checks, updates, or reconciles information   we can automate it.**

---

## how our agents work

Our agents replicate the same steps a human completes, but faster and with perfect consistency:

1. Log into a system
2. Find the required data
3. Interpret and understand it
4. Apply rules, logic, or decisions
5. Insert or update information in another system
6. Trigger follow-on actions or workflows

They operate continuously inside your secure environment.

---

## where we deliver the biggest impact

We specialise in removing repetitive work across:

- **Finance** – reconciliations, invoice processing, reporting, data syncs
- **HR / People** – onboarding, records management, compliance tasks
- **Operations** – admin, scheduling, database upkeep, process flows
